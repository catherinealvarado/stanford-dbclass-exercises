/* These exercises are from the Stanford SQL course.

You've started a new movie-rating website, and you've been collecting data
on reviewers' ratings of various movies. There's not much data yet, but you
can still try out some interesting queries. Here's the schema: 

Movie ( mID,  (movie with ID)
	    title,   (movie title)
	    year,   (release year)
	   director (a director)
	   )

Reviewer ( rID,  (reviewer with ID number)
		  name (reviewer name)
	        )

Rating ( rID,  (reviewer rID)
             mID, (movie mID )
	     stars, (number of stars rating (1-5) )
	     ratingDate (ratingDate)
	   )
