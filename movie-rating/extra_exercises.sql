/* These exercises are from the Stanford SQL course.
The same movie rating tables are being used, but the queries
are extra SQL queries from the course.

You've started a new movie-rating website, and you've been collecting data
on reviewers' ratings of various movies.
Here's the schema for each table:

Movie (mID,     (Movie's unique ID)
	     title,   (Title of the movie)
	     year,    (Movie release year)
	     director (Movie director))

Reviewer (rID,  (Movie reviewer ID)
		      name  (Reviewer name))

Rating (rID,    (Reviewer rID)
        mID,    (Movie's unique ID)
	      stars,  (Number of stars rating (1-5) for movie)
	      ratingDate (Date movie was rated))
